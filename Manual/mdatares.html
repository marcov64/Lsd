<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
During a simulation run some of the data produced are stored in memory
(the model configuration indicates which series, Variables or
Parameters,
have to be saved. See the section for <a href="Browser.html#variables">Variables
in the main Browser</a>). This data can be accessed by by means of the
<b>Analysis
of Result</b> module, which offers the possibility to observe the data
in a variety of formats. The <b>Analysis of Result</b> module is
activated
in four different cases:
<ol>
  <li>From the <b><a href="menudata.html#analres">Browser</a></b>
using
the data produced by the latest simulation, which are stored in memory
until a new simulation run is launched;</li>
  <li>during a <a href="debug.html">debugging
session</a> (button <b>Analysis</b>), when a simulation is
interrupted;
in this case the data are available up to the next to last simulation
step,
and after the analysis of (partial) result the simulation can continue;</li>
  <li>loading the data from a file containing simulation data
previously
saved.
This option is alwasy offered even when a data set is available in
memory
as in the previous two cases.</li>
  <li>Loading data currently stored in the model. These series can be
analysed only at the current time step, that is they are available with
one value.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><br>
The window for the <b>Analysis of Result </b>shows the data available
listed in the <a href="#Vars__Available"><b>Series Available</b></a>
list box. The series to be
elaborated
must be selected and moved in the central list <b>Series Selected</b>:
all the commands concerning plotting, producing statistics or save data
concern only the series in this box. Users can select the options
available
and then issue one of the following commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>graphical representations of the series.</b> The series are
plotted
in graphs in different arrangements according to the options chosen
(e.g.
time series or cross section). The graphs are shown in individual
windows
which are listed in the rightmost list box <b>Graphs</b>, and can be
brought
up in the foreground by double-clicking on their title in the list;</li>
  <li> <b>descriptive statistics</b>, either taken over time or
cross-section.
They are printed in the Log window;</li>
  <li> <b>text files</b>, containing in the columns the series
produced. A
variety
of formats are available for export from Lsd, to be subsequently
imported
in an external package for further elaboration;</li>
  <li> <b>postscript files</b> containing the graphical representation
produced
on the windows in a format suitable for inclusion in a word processor.</li>
</ul>
The user can set a number of options for each of the above operations.
Therefore, each operation is made by the following actions:
<ol>
  <li>Empty the central list box, if necessary.</li>
  <li>Select the series of interest in the <b>Series Available </b>list
box,
possibly after sorting the available series in a suitable order or
filtering them in a particular way, and
move
them in the central list box <b>Series Selected</b> (button "<b>&gt;").</b></li>
  <li>Set the options of interest (e.g. automatic scaling, color or no
color
graphs, type of plotting, etc.)</li>
  <li>Issue the command (e.g. plot, statistics etc.)</li>
  <li>If necessary, compare with the model description (e.g. the
equation for
the Variable plotted) available from the menu <b>Help</b></li>
</ol>
The module <b>Analysis of Result<i> </i></b>does not interfere with
the
other activities of a Lsd model program, so that it is possible, for
example,
to analyse the partial results during a simulation and then continue
it.
See <a href="#elements">the complete description </a>of the elements
available
in the <b>Analysis of Result </b>window.
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="Vars__Available"></a><b>Series Available</b>
<br>
List of the series available. The series are presented in the following
format:
<br>
<b><tt><font size="+1">InstallBase 1_11 (30 - 200)</font></tt></b>
<br>
which contains the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the name of the Variable or Parameter (<b><tt><font size="+1">InstallBase</font></tt></b>);</li>
  <li>a code to distinguish between the same Variables or Parameters in
different
Objects of the model (<b><tt><font size="+1">1_11</font></tt></b>).
This
code contains as many digits as the hierarchical level of the Object
containing
the Variable, in the example the first highest level Object and the
eleventh
of the second level. The user can check in the model report, observable
from the menu <b>Help</b>, where the Variable is placed.</li>
  <li>the first and last simulation time step for which the data are
available
(<b><tt><font size="+1">30 - 200</font></tt></b>). In the example the
Object
containing this Variable has been created in the 30th time step, and
lasted
up to 200th time step.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Sorting series</i></b>
<br>
The order of the series reflects the structure of the model, and
therefore
variables saved from the same Object are listed sequentially. For large
models it may be useful to <a href="#sort">sort the series </a>available
in one of the available formats.
<p><b><i>Selection Methods</i></b>
<br>
From this list variables must be selected to be moved in the list of
the <b>Series Selected</b>. using the&nbsp; <a href="#in">Button
'&gt;'</a>.
The labels can be selected using the mouse with the usual bindings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;click on one label to select it and de-select any other;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;keep the control key pressed and click on a label to add it
to
the
selection without de-selecting other ones.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;click on a selected label to de-select it;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;click and scroll the mouse pointer oevr the listbox to
select all
the labels encountered;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;click on one label, keep the shift key pressed and click on
another
label to select all the labels between the two;</li>
</ul>
It is possible to select a group of items with the same label, and also
filtering these according to their instance code, using the right
button
of the mouse on one of the labels to select. See help on the <a href="#batch_sel">batch
selection</a> on this.
<p><b><i>Variables' equations</i></b>
<br>
Clicking with the right button of the mouse while keeping the shift
key pressed the system pops up a window showing the code for the
variable.
Note that if the series concern a parameter's value, this operation has
no effect.
</p>
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="vtoplot"></a><b>Series Selected</b>
<br>
This list contains the active series, to be plotted, saved, made
statistics
about. These series have been moved in from the <b>Series Available </b>list
box and pressing the <b>button "&gt;"</b>.
<br>
The same selection rules as in listbox <b><a href="#Vars__Available">Series
Available</a></b> apply. Pressing the <b>button "&lt;"</b> removes
from
this list all the selected labels.<b> </b>Pressing the button <b>Empty</b>
removes all the series in this box, selected or not selected,
equivalent
to select all the labels in this box.
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="in"></a><b>Button "&gt;"</b>
<br>
Insert in the listbox <b>Series Selected</b> the variables selected
in the <b>Series Available</b>.
</p>
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="out"></a><b>Button "&lt;"</b>
<br>
Remove the selected labels from listbox <b>Series Selected</b>.
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="sort"></a><b>Buttons concerning Sorting</b>
<br>
The labels shown in the <b>Series Available</b> list box are sorted
according to the Object that contain them, starting from the highest
level
Objects to the lowest ones. When there are many series it may is useful
to list all series of the same type together, so to make easier their
selection.
The avaiable sorting criteria are:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Sort</b>: list the series according to their increasing
label
alphabetical
order and to their code.</li>
  <li> <b>Sort (end)</b>: sort the labels according to, firstly, their
increasing
alphabetical label order, and, secondly, then to their "end" date, the
time step when the Object containing the Variable has been removed by
the
model. If no Object has been removed during the simulation, this option
sorts the labels identically to the previous one, <b>Sort</b>. But if
some
Object have been removed, this sorting method shows sequentially the
series
with the same labels placing first the series in Objects still existing.</li>
  <li> <b>Un-sort</b>: reproduce the original order of the series,
with
the ones
contained in the highest Objects first, and then grouped according the
Object containing them.</li>
</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<br>
<a name="empty"></a><b>Button "Clear"</b>
<br>
Removes all the labels from the listbox <b>Series Selected</b>.
Equivalent
to select all labels in the listbox and pressing button "&lt;".
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="add_series"></a><b>Button "Add series"</b>
<br>
Add more data series for analysis to the ones currently available,
taken from the current model, from previously saved result files, or
from elaborations of the
selected series.<br>
<br>
<img src="choosedata.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 247px; height: 221px;"><br>
By default the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis of Result</span>
module loads in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Series Available </span>listbox
all the series saved during the latest simulation run (that is the data
contained in variables or parameters <a href="Browser.html#variables">marked
to be saved</a>). Besides these data, the user can load three other
types of data to the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Analysis of Result</span>
module:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Data from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">current
configuration</span> of the model. These data will conventionally be
marked as data at time step 0, and can be used to make cross-section
graphs or statistics only, since the system can retrieve only the
values of the elements at the current time step. Note that the system
offers a auto-completion facility, so that the window to inser the
label of the desired element is automatically filled in. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Data loaded from&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">file(s)
of Lsd
results</span> saved from a previous simulation run(s). This option
loads
the data from a files selected with the usual file selection
method. When a file is loaded, its series will be marked by adding a
"F" letter in the end of the label, and the file is assigned an
increasing number, indicated in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Log</span>
window. This file number is also indicated in the first location of the
tag of the series. This convention permits to differentiate from series
produced during the last simulation run, from those data loaded from
the file and, in case, of the different data files loaded.&nbsp; It is
possible to also load several files, usually produced by&nbsp; <a href="file:///C:/Lsd5.5/Manual/menurun.html#simsetting">multiple runs</a>.
  </li>
  <li>(<span style="font-style: italic;">available only if some series
is present in the </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Series Selected</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> listbox</span>) Data from <span style="font-weight: bold;">creation of new series</span> obtained as
elaboration of the selected series. The system can generate a new
series using the average, minimum, maximum or variance of the selected
series. The user is asked to specify the label of the new variable and
the tag. See <a href="#create_series">here for further details</a>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="create_series"></a>Create Series</span><br>
<img style="width: 254px; height: 531px;" alt="" src="CreateSeries.jpg"><br>
<br>
This option elaborates selected series creating a single new series. The existing
series can be scanned along two dimensions:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compute over series</span>: the
new variable will be composed by as many time steps as the selected
ones. Each time step value is computed elaborating the same time step
values of the selected series. For example, (choosing Average) being <span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>t</sub><sup>j</sup></span> the value
of series <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span> (with <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span>={1, 2, ...n}) at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span> the new series will be computed
as: <span style="font-style: italic;">NewSeries<sub>t</sub></span>=SUM<span style="font-style: italic;"><sub>j</sub></span><span style="font-family: symbol;">[<span style="font-style: italic;">
    </span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>t</sub><sup>j</sup>
</span>]<span style="font-style: italic;"> / n</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compute over cases</span>: The
new series will be composed by as many time steps as the number of
series selected. Each value is computed elaborating all the values for
one of the series selected across all the time steps of the series. For example, (choosing Average) being <span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>t</sub><sup>j</sup></span> the value
of series <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span> at time <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span> the new series will be computed,
for the conventional time step <span style="font-style: italic;">j</span>,
as: <span style="font-style: italic;">NewSeries<sub>j</sub></span>=SUM<span style="font-style: italic;"><sub>t</sub></span><span style="font-family: symbol;">[<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><span style="font-family: symbol;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">v<sub>t</sub><sup>j</sup></span> ]<span style="font-style: italic;"> / m, </span>where&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> is the total number of time steps of the series</li>
</ul>
The new series can be computed as the average, maximum, minimum,
variance, standard deviation (multiplied by a factor) and simple count
of the values in the series. The user must specify a label and a <span style="font-style: italic;">tag</span>, the set of digits used for Lsd
model series used to differentiate&nbsp;for series in different
objects.<br><br>It
is possible to filter away data during the elaboration. For example, it
is possible to let the calculation ignore all values below or above a
specified value.<br>

available.
<br>
<hr width="100%">

<br>
<a name="scaling"></a><a name="yscaling"></a><b>"Y Self-scaling"</b>
<br>
<img src="yselfscaling.jpg" height="31" width="325"><br>
If this option is checked on, the graph will automatically set the

option
to set manually the max and min Y values.
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="minmaxy"></a><b>"Min. Y - Max. Y "</b>

These cells can be accessed on if <b>Y Self-scaling </b>is set off.
It sets the graph's minimum and maximum Y to the values indicated.
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="y2axis"></a><b>Y2 Axis</b>
<br>
<img src="y2_axis.jpg" height="23" width="265"><br>
Only for time series graphs, it is possible to use a double Y axis.
That is, some of the series selected will be plotted along one scale,
and
other series will be used on another one. These graphs are constrained
to use the automatically determined scaling. When this option is on,
the
user must select a number indicating the first series to be plotted
according
to the second scale. All the series after the indicated series will use
the secondary scale. Therefore, this number must be included between 2
and the number of series in the listbox <b>Series Selected</b>.
<p>Notice that the secondary scale is indicated among parenthesis in
the
Y axis (see the <a href="#y2example">example graph</a>). Pressing the
Shift

of
the secondary scale.
</p>
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="title"></a><b>"Title"</b>
<br>
Allows users to assign a title to the graph. The title will be used
in the list of graph and as header to the window showing it. By
default,
the system assigns as title name the very first variable in the list of
the ones to be plotted.
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="watch"></a><b>"Watch"</b>

the graph.
<br>
If checked off, users cannot access the Lsd windows during the plot
of graphs. This is relevant because during the creation of a graph the
user can abort the plotting (the button for <b>Plot</b> is changed in <b>Stop</b>),
if the graph is too complex and taking too much time to be plotted.
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="timeseries"></a><a name="plot"></a><b>Button "Plot"</b>
<br>
This button creates a <a href="#graphs">graph window</a> plotting the
data from series listed in
<b>Series Selected</b> and using the options
for: <a href="#xscaling">Cases to Plot</a>; <a href="#yscaling">Y
scale</a>;
<a href="#color">Color</a>;
<a href="#lines_points">Lines

<a href="#point_size">Point size</a>; <a href="#grids">Grids</a>,
<a href="#ts_cs">Time
Series / Cross Section</a> option, <a href="#seq_xy">Sequence / XY
Plotting</a>
option.
<br>
The graphs produced depend on the options <b>Time Series / Cross
Section
</b>and
<b>Sequence
/ XY Plotting</b> chosen, and the number of series selected, for a
total
of five different types of graphs:
</p>
<p><i><u>Time Series &amp; Sequence&nbsp;</u></i><img src="ts_seq.jpg" height="52" width="212">
<br>
The standard time series plotting, where X contains the time step of
the simulation and the series are plotted. The system automatically
removes
series non existing during the cases considered, or truncates as
necessary.
Lines connects points from the same series in different times. Note
that
if the number of time steps is larger than the available definition
(640
points) the system computes one single point (the average) for each
datum
falling in the same X value.
</p>
<p><i><u>Cross Section &amp; Sequence&nbsp;</u></i><img src="cr_seq.jpg" height="57" width="213">
<br>
The X axis corresponds to the series, the Y axis to their value and
the lines with different colors correspond to a particular time step of
the simulation. The cases to plot, and the order in which the Variables
has to appear in the X axis, are set with a specific <a href="#crosssection">window</a>.
It is possible to rank the series listed in the X axis according to
increasing
or decreasing values (at a certain time step), or to use the same rank
as appear in the Series Selected listbox. A label below the X axis
reports
the number of series used. The lines connect points from the different
series at the same time step.
</p>
<p><i><u>Time Series &amp; XY Plotting and <b>more than one </b>series
selected&nbsp;</u></i><img src="ts_xy.jpg" height="54" width="219">
<br>
The X axis reports the values from the very first series in the window
<b>Series
Selected</b>. The graph will contain a line for each subsequent series,
placing a point for each value from the first series. For example,
suppose
there are three series in the <b>Series Selected</b> list (X<sup>1</sup>,
X<sup>2</sup>, and X<sup>3</sup>). The graph will contain two lines (or
groups of points) at the coordinates (X<sup>1</sup><sub>t</sub>,X<sup>2</sup><sub>t</sub>)
and (X<sup>1</sup><sub>t</sub>,X<sup>3</sup><sub>t</sub>), for each
time
step t included in the user's <a href="#xscaling">selection of cases</a>.
The graph is produced by gnuplot (see here for details on how to manage
the windows produced by gnuplot).
</p>
<p><i><u>Time Series &amp; XY Plotting and <b>one single series </b>selected&nbsp;</u></i><img src="ts_xy.jpg" height="54" width="219">
<br>
This graph reports the phase diagram of a series. The X axes contain
values of the series selected, and on the Y axes are reported the
values
of future time. It is possible to insert a 45° line in the graph so
to indicate the stable points (where X<sub>t</sub>=X<sub>t+1</sub>).
The
user is requested to insert a lag value, and a single series will be
produced
for each lag. For example, consider the user requesting three lags. The
graph will contains two series at the coordinates (X<sub>t</sub>,X<sub>t+1</sub>)
and (X<sub>t</sub>,X<sub>t+2</sub>) respectively.
</p>
<p><i><u>Cross Section &amp; XY Plotting</u></i><img src="cr_xy.jpg" height="52" width="218">
<br>
This graph considers data from a single time step. It uses the values
from a group of series for the X values and produces lines from
group(s)
of other series.
<br>
The user is asked to specify one single time step and how many series
will give the values for the X axis. It is necessary that the number of
series chosen for the X axis is an exact divisor of the rest of the
series.
For example, if the <b>Series Selected</b> list contains 6000 series,
the
user can choose 1000, 2000 or 3000 as "block length". If 2000 is chosen
(and k is the time step chosen) the system considers the values from
the
first 2000 series as values defining the X axis, and two other data
sets
(from the 2001 to 4000, and from 4001 to 6000) that will provide the Y
values to plot. The graph will therefore contain two lines defined by
the
2000 points each with coordinates {(X<sup>1</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>2001</sup><sub>k</sub>),
(X<sup>2</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>2002</sup><sub>k</sub>), ..., (X<sup>2000</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>4000</sup><sub>k</sub>)}
for the first series and&nbsp; {(X<sup>1</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>4001</sup><sub>k</sub>),
(X<sup>2</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>4002</sup><sub>k</sub>), ..., (X<sup>2000</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>6000</sup><sub>k</sub>)}
for the second.

<a name="Gnuplot"></a><b>Gnuplot</b>
<br>
<tt><font size="+1">Gnuplot</font></tt> is a package, distributed
freely,
for creating graphical representations of numerical series. It is a
very
powerful and flexible tool, which is frequently installed by default in
Unix systems. For Windows is available <tt><font size="+1">wgnuplot</font></tt>,
which is included in the Lsd distribution. <tt><font size="+1">Gnuplot</font></tt>
can be run from the operative system or launched from its menu entry in
the main <a href="#top">Analysis of Result </a>window, normally to
operate
on a file created with the <a href="#save">Save Data</a> command
(remember
to place a # before the labels' line).
<p>Lsd uses <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt> automatically to
create
the XY graphs (see <a href="#plot">plot</a> for further details). It
is
a three steps procedure:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>create a data file and a command file with the data to use and
the <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>
commands for the desired graph; these files are located in a
subdirectory
of the model's own directory named plotxy_n, where n is the graph
number
reported in the <b>Graph</b> listbox.</li>
  <li>execute <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>'s commands
resulting
in graph
with a format suitable to be imported in Tcl/Tk, the graphical language
used by Lsd.</li>
  <li>create a standard Lsd windows for a graph importing the <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>
generated graph.</li>
</ol>
Step 3 may be dangerous for Windows OS's. In fact, Tcl/Tk is likely to
crash when a too large graph is created (and all of your simulation
results
are lost...). To avoid this a control asks users whether to skip step 3
in case the graph appears too large (&gt; 0.5 Mb). Instead of creating
the
Lsd internal windows, it is possible to generate a <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>
graph window, which is not related to the Lsd program. Such windows
need
to be closed explicitly, which is done by using a small windows created
together with the main <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt> graphs
window.
<br>
<tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt> offers a wide set of options,
and Lsd exploits only a small part of these. However, it is possible to
edit the options used to create XY graphs and make them appear in the
Lsd
windows. See <a href="#replot_gnuplot">here</a> how to do this.
<br>
Users willing to create sophisticated graphs, beyond the Lsd
possibilities,
can save the necessary data using the <a href="#save">Save Data</a>
command.
Then, run <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt> (<tt><font size="+1">wgnuplot</font></tt>
for Windows users) from menu Help and exploit all the <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>
possibilities (see the <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>
extensive
help typing "help" in the <tt><font size="+1">gnuplot</font></tt>
editor).<br><br><br>
<hr width="100%"><a name="gpoptions"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gnuplot options</span><br>These
options concern the terminal defined in gnuplot. The system
automatically recognizes the operative system used, and set the values
accordingly, although in some cases (e.g. Mac OS) there may be
different alternatives. Normally, MS Windows users should use the
"windows" terminal, while Linux and Mac users should use "x11".
However, Mac users can also use "aqua".<br>The second option concern the level of detail used by gnuplot for the 3D graphs. For details see the gnuplot help for "dgrid3d".<br>
<hr width="100%"><br><br>
<a name="replot_gnuplot"></a><b>XY Plotting and Gnuplot (for expert
users)</b>
<br>
The XY plots are generated using the gnuplot package (wgnuplot for
Windows). Gnuplot is used in batch mode. That is, Lsd prepares the
files
with the data ("data.gp") and with the commands for gnuplot
("gnuplot.lsd").
The resulting graph ("plot.file") is exported in the terminal&nbsp; <i>tkcanvas</i>
and
then sourced in the Lsd own Tcl/Tk interpreter. The files generated for
this process are kept on the disk <i>up to the closing </i>of the
Analysis
of Result module, during which they are removed. Users may exploit
these
files to run gnuplot interactively, for example generating XYZ plots,
errorbars
etc. For this purpose Lsd generates also a gnuplot command file
("gnuplot.gp")
that contains the same commands for the plot without the instructions
for
generating a <i>tkcanvas</i>.
<p>Users may customize the gnuplot graphs by acting directly on the
commands
to gnuplot. To do this use the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a graph using the desired series with the <b>XY Plot </b>option
on. This will store the data for the graph in the file 'data.gp'
located
in a directory called <b>plotxy_N</b>, where N is the plot number,
descending
from the model directory. See the <b>Model Info</b> <a href="LMM_help.html#modelinfo">in
LMM</a> to know the model directory. The file <b>gnuplot.gp</b> will
contain
the gnuplot commands.</li>
  <li>Close the window containing the generated plot.</li>
  <li>Open with an editor (e.g. LMM itself) the file <b>gnuplot.gp</b>.</li>
  <li>Edit and save the file <b>gnuplot.gp</b>. For example, add a
line
stating <tt>set
nokey</tt> and save.</li>
  <li>Double-click on the item in <b>Graphs</b> corresponding on the
deleted
graph,</li>
</ol>
The system will generate a new gnuplot graph applying the edited
commands,
in the example above will use the same options but will not print the
legend.
<p>Note that the graphs exported from gnuplot to Tk tend to be pretty
large.
Before loading them Lsd scans these files (reaching even tens of Mb's)
and removes the duplications, leaving manageable files of few tens of
Kb's.
</p>
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="lines_points"></a><b>Lines / Points</b>
<br>
This option allows users to create graph with lines or points. Note
that for graphs using a large number of values the lines can be just an
approximation of the positions of the actual values.

<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="crosssection"></a><b>Selection of Cases for "Cross Section"
Analysis</b>
<br>
When the option <a href="#ts_cs">"Cross Section"</a> is checked on
(but in the case of XY plots), this function allows to decide the
cases,
i.e. the time steps, to consider as single series. It applies both for
<a href="#plot">plots</a>
(where one line indicates a time step over all the Variables selected)
or for <a href="#statistics">statistics</a>, taken over the Variables
selected
at a given time.
<br>
The window below asks users the list of cases to be considered, to
be typed and added to a list, and then the sorting.
</p>
<p><img src="insert_cross.jpg" align="absbottom" height="297" width="485"></p>
<p>The leftmost section of the window contains the entry where to type
the cases to use. Below the entry there is the list of cases already
selected.
</p>
<p>The central part contains four buttons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Add</b>: include the typed case in the list of time steps
selected.
It is equivalent to pressing the key Enter.</li>
  <li> <b>Delete</b>: remove from the list of time steps the elements
currently
highlighted</li>
  <li> <b>Continue</b>: end the insertion of cases and continue the
operation
of plotting, or making statistics on, the cases selected (short cut: c).</li>
  <li> <b>Abort</b>: abort the operation, returning to the main
Anlysis of
Result
window</li>
</ul>
The rightmost section concerns the sorting of the Variables, to appear
as the X axis on the cross section graph (it is ignored for the
statistics
command). It contains a label indicating the option currently chosen,
which
changes when pressing one of the three buttons:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Sorting Ascending</b>: the Variables will appear according
to
their
increasing values at the time highlighted in the list of Time Steps
selected
when the button is pressed. That is, the Variable with the lowest value
at the time indicated will appear on the left of the graph, while the
Variable
with the highest value at the same time step will appear on the right
of
the graph.</li>
  <li> <b>Sorting Descending</b>: the Variables will appear according
to
their
decreasing values at the time highlighted in the list of Time Steps
selected
when the button is pressed. That is, the Variable with the highest
value
at the time indicated will appear on the left of the graph, while the
Variable
with the lowest value at the same time step will appear on the right of
the graph.</li>
  <li> <b>No sort</b>: the order of the Variables will be the same
used in
the
list of <b>Vars. to Plot</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you want to insert a sequence of times, to generate many
series, there are several shortcuts:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Control-f</span> (for <span style="font-style: italic;">from</span>). The value indicated will be
used as the first time step to insert.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Control-t</span> (for <span style="font-style: italic;">to</span>). The value indicated will be
used as the last time step to insert.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Control-x</span> . The value
indicated will be used as step of the series. For example, starting
from 2 and setting step 3 you will insert 2-5-8-11-14 etc, until the
value indicated for final time.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Control-z</span> . Insert the
series as defined. If no step value have been indicated it will use
step 1.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="save"></a><b>Button "Save Data"</b>
<br>
This command exports variable values from the <b>Series Selected </b>window
in a text file made of as many columns as the Variables chosen and as
many
lines as the cases indicated with the <a href="#xscaling">Cases to use</a>
option. Two types of data files are available:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Lsd Result Files</b>: file contains data that can be loaded
in a
new
session of Analysis of Result in Lsd</li>
  <li> <b>Text Files</b>: file contains data in a generalized format</li>
</ul>
Many options are available for the the case of text files.
<p><b><i>Labels to use</i></b><img src="lab_to_use.jpg" align="right" height="132" width="164">
<br>
The option "Original" leaves the same series name as in the Lsd model,
attaching a progressive number to distinguish between different
instances
of the same series. This options can cause problems when Variables have
long names and the packages meant to be used for the data treatment
accepts
only few characters (e.g. SPSS and Statistica use only up to 8
characters
for variables names). The option <b>New Names </b>allows users to
assign
a name that replaces the original name of the variable, and the system
assigns a progressive number to distinguish between the different
variables.
For example, if the new name assigned is "Col", the series will be
indicated
by Col1, Col2 etc.
<br>
Users can add a '#' symbol before the first line indicating the
Variable's
labels. This is the standard for files accepted by <a href="#Gnuplot">gnuplot</a>
which ignores the columns' headers.
</p>
<p><b><i>Columns delimiter&nbsp;</i></b><img src="col_delimiter.jpg" align="right" height="157" width="163">
<br>
Three options are available. The default is the standard Tab delimited
file, where the column are separated by the tab character (accepted by
most packages). The second option allows users to specify their own
delimiter
for columns (e.g. semicolon, spaces etc.). The last option allows users
to create fixed length columns. This means that each column will
contain
exactly the spaces indicated. For variables labels (first line) the
possible
extra spaces are filled with spaces, while for the values are filled
trailing
decimal zeros.

<p><b><i>General Options&nbsp;</i></b><img src="gen_options.jpg" align="right" height="96" width="164">

Lastly, users can decide whether to have variables labels in the first
row of the file (some packages don't accept data mixed with labels). In
case there are missing data, users can specify the code for missing
values.

<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="statistics"></a><b>Button "Statistics"</b>
<br>
This button causes Lsd to compute few descriptive statistics on the
variables' values selected in Vars. To Plot listbox. Depending on the
options
chosen, the statistics can be computed on all cases for each variable (<b>Time
Series</b>) or single cases for all variables (<b>Cross Section</b>).
Moreover,
in case of time series statistics, the statistics are computed only on
the cases set with the option for <a href="#xscaling">X self scaling</a>.
The statistics appear in the <a href="Log.html">log

<ul>
  <li>average;</li>

  <li>minimum</li>
  <li>maximum</li>
  <li>standard deviation</li>
</ul>
The statistics are reported on lines containing, for time series

<p>The header indicates the number of cases considered in all. But, if

This option allows to consider <a href="#plot">plots</a> and <a href="#statistics">statistics</a>

the data used are all the values in the <a href="#xscaling">range of

<a name="seq_xy"></a><b>Option "Sequence / XY Plots"</b>
<br>
This option allows to consider alternatively <a href="#plot">plots</a>
of a sequence of values or as a XY mapping. The case of <b>Sequence</b>
consider each data set as identical to the others. Instead, the case of
<b>XY
Plots</b> consider one data set as to be placed on the X axis of the
graph
and the other(s) to be plotted as corresponding Y's.
<br>
The actual type of graph depends also on the option <b>Time Series</b>
/ <b>Cross Section (</b>see <a href="#ts_cs">above</a> or on
<a href="#plot">help
on plot</a> for further details).
<br>
In the following is discussed the case of <b>XY Plots</b>.
<ul>
  <li>In case of <b>Time Series</b> the X axis will be occupied by the
values
of the very first entry in the list of the <b>Series Selected</b>. and
the graph will consider as separate data sets any other series. For
example,
suppose there are three series in the <b>Series Selected</b> list, X<sup>1</sup>,
X<sup>2</sup>, and X<sup>3</sup> The graph will contain two lines (or
groups
of points) at the coordinates (X<sup>1</sup><sub>t</sub>,X<sup>2</sup><sub>t</sub>)
and (X<sup>1</sup><sub>t</sub>,X<sup>3</sup><sub>t</sub>), for each
time
step t included in the user's <a href="#xscaling">selection of cases</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In case of <b>Cross Section</b>, the user will be asked to
specify one
single time step and how many series will give the values for the X
axis.
It is necessary that the number of series chosen for the X axis is an
exact
divisor of the rest of the series. For example, if the <b>Series
Selected</b>
list contains 6000 series, the user can choose 1000, 2000 or 3000 as
"block
length". If 2000 is chosen (and k is the time step chosen) the system
considers
the values from the first 2000 series as values defining the X axis,
and
two other data sets (from the 2001 to 4000, and from 4001 to 6000) that
will provide the Y values to plot. The graph will therefore contain two
lines defined by the 2000 points with coordinates {(X<sup>1</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>2001</sup><sub>k</sub>),
(X<sup>2</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>2002</sup><sub>k</sub>), ..., (X<sup>2000</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>4000</sup><sub>k</sub>)}
for the first series and&nbsp; {(X<sup>1</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>4001</sup><sub>k</sub>),
(X<sup>2</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>4002</sup><sub>k</sub>), ..., (X<sup>2000</sup><sub>k</sub>,X<sup>6000</sup><sub>k</sub>)}
for the second.</li>
</ul>
Note that the XY graphs are not generated by Lsd directly but are

<a name="batch_sel"></a><b>Batch Selection</b>
<br>
When users need to select many series in the listboxes <span style="font-weight: bold;">Series Available</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Series Selected</span> it is possible to
click on one label with the right button of the mouse in order to use a
general criterion to operate with a whole set of series with that
label. In the example below the mouse was clicked with the right button
of the mouse on the label <span style="font-weight: bold;">HerfEval</span>.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="add_batch.jpg" style="width: 331px; height: 433px;" align="middle"><br>
<br>
There are three possible criteria:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Select all the series</span>:
select all the series with the chosen label.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Select for series' tags:</span>
series are associated with tags containing as many numbers as the
hierachy of objects containing them. In the example, the variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">HerfEval</span> is located in an object in
the third hierarchical level, and therefore you need two digits to
indicate the exact copy of the object containing it: one for the second
layer and one for the third layer (the first layer is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Root</span> which is present with only one
copy). Choosing this criterion, the user can place one value in one of
the cells (only one) and the system will select all the series
respecting the condition in respect of the indicated number in the
tag's position indicated by the cell.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Select for values of another
series</span>: it is possible to select the series in respect of the
values that another series in the same object takes at a given time
step. The user needs to indicate the label of the other series, the
time step to be used, and the value to be used for comparison. The
condition indicates the criterion by which to compare the value of the
selecting series.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Inserting no values in the cells the system will add all the copies
of the label ("numLinkA" in the example) in the <a href="#vtoplot">Series
Selected</a> listbox. Inserting one value, the system will insert only
the copies having the inserted value in the position of the cell used. <br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="3dCrossSection"></a>
Cross-section Scatter plots</span><br>
This option is activated when the user selects <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cross-Section</span> in the <a href="#ts_cs">Time Series/Cross-section</a> option and <span style="font-weight: bold;">XY-graphs</span> in the <a href="#seq_xy">Sequence/XY-graph</a>
option and press the button <a href="#plot">Plot</a>.
The graph generated will be a scatter plot built with points composed
from data in the series selected at a specific time. That is, from each
series selected the system extracts one value at the specified time.
The graph can be composed by points or line as indicated by the option
on the main Analysis of Results window. These values are re-arreanged
to generated 2 or more variables: one or two independent ones (for 2D
or 3D graphs respectively), and one or more dependent ones.<br><br>Users
need to provide the number of series that must be plotted, which depend
on the number of series selected (call it M), the number of indepedent
series (say N) and whether the graph will be 2D or 3D.<br><br>The
series selected are considered sequentially, according to the order
used in the Series Selected listbox. The M series used will be divided
in N+1, for 2D graphs or N+2 blocks containing an identical number of
series. The first block (for 2D) or the first two (for 3D) will be
considered the values for the independent variable(s), used for the
horizontal axis or plane. The remaing series will be the dependent
ones, appearing on the vertical axis.<br><br>For example, suppose you
selected 120 series. If N=2, that is, there are two dependent series to
plot, if you choose a 2D each variable in the graph will contain 40
points. If you select a 3D graph each variable in the graph will
contain 30 points.<br><br>
<img alt="" src="cd3Dcs.jpg" style="width: 179px; height: 361px;" align="middle"><br>
<br>The user must provide the following information:<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time step</span>:
Time step of the values to extract from the series selected. Series
whose initial and final time of existence is 0 (conventional values
indicatating that the series is actually composed by a single value)
will always used that value, irrrespective of the time step indicated.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2D or 3D</span>: generate a plot in 2 or 3 dimensions.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3D options</span>:
For 3D graphs only gnuplot offers the possibility to use "gridded"
data. Instead of considering the actual values, gnuplot will divide the
plane of the independent variables in equally spaced squares,
interpolating the values in those squares. In case of gridded data it
is possible to replace the lines or points with a colored surface.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of independent variables</span>:
the user must indicate how many&nbsp;dependent variables must appear in
the graph, generating as many lines (or surfaces) as a function of the
independent ones.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Num. of points</span>:
for control only, the system indicates the number of points on the
independent variable (or plane) can be constructed with the options
indicated.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Window type</span>:
the graph generated can be placed either into a normal Lsd graph
window, or as an external window managed by gnuplot. The latter has
normally better quality and many features (e.g. it is possible to
rotate 3D graphs), but cannot be exported as with the Lsd windows. <br><br><br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="3dTime"></a>3D Time Series Graphs</span><br>
This option is activated when the user selects <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Series</span> in the <a href="mdatares.html#ts_cs">Time Series/Cross-section</a> option, <span style="font-weight: bold;">XY-graphs</span> in the <a href="mdatares.html#seq_xy">Sequence/XY-graph</a>
option, and 3 or more series appear in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Series
Selected</span> listbox. and press the button <a href="mdatares.html#plot">Plot</a>.
The graph will consider the first two series as independent variables
plotted on a horizontal plane and the subsequent series as
dependent variables plotted on the vertical axis. The user is requested
to choose between a 2D graph with multiple dependent variables or a 3D
graph with one or more independent variables. The same options as for
the <a href="#3dCrossSection">Cross-Section 3D graphs </a>apply.<br><br><br><img style="width: 179px; height: 280px;" alt="" src="cd3Dts.jpg"><br><br>The same options as for
the <a href="mdatares.html#3dCrossSection">Cross-Section 3D graphs </a>apply.
The additional option concern the possibility to generate 3D graphs
using the time as one of the independent variables, while the first
series selected will be the other variable on the plane of the graph.<br><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="3DOptions"></a>3D Graphs options</span><br>
There a many ways to customize a 3D graph, giving the flexibility
offered by gnuplot. Unfortunately, they are less than obvious, and so
in this section we present how&nbsp; Lsd user can easily modify the
most relevant aspects of a 3D graph. The graphs appear in a window that
can be closed clicking on the button <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span>
in a small window telling <span style="font-weight: bold;">Click to
close</span>.<br>
<br>
Lsd generates surface graphs, either with a color or a gray scale, like
the one depicted below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="ex3dsurface.jpg" style="width: 952px; height: 690px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Such image can be rotated by clicking with the main button of the mouse
and moving it across the image. For example, you can immediately
observe the next image.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="ex3dsurface1.jpg" style="width: 952px; height: 690px;"><br>
<br>
In order to export such graphs there is not, unfortunately, a direct
way. You need to click with the mouse over the bar topping the window
containing the graph. From there choose the option to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Copy to clipboard</span> the image. Then
you can past the image in a graphical package, for exampe <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paint</span> in Windows (menu Accessories),
and save the image with your preferred format.<br>
<br>
In order to access more sophisticated options you need to know how Lsd
uses gnuplot. When a gnuplot graph needs to be produced, Lsd generates
a new directory and places there several files. One file is called <span style="font-family: monospace;">data.gp</span>, containing the values
used for the graph. The other two files <span style="font-family: monospace;">gnuplot.gp</span>and <span style="font-family: monospace;">gnuplot.lsd</span>, contain the
commands to gnuplot in order to elaborate the data. Lsd generates a new
graph anytime you double click on the name of the graph using the
commands contained in <span style="font-family: monospace;">gnuplot.gp</span>.
Therefore, in order to generate a modified 3D graph you need to:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Generate the graph with the default options.</li>
  <li>Close the newly generated window with the graph.</li>
  <li>Opening the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">gnuplot.gp</span>
with any text editor (for example, with LMM), considering that the
directory containing it is called <span style="font-family: monospace;">plotxy_N</span>
where <span style="font-family: monospace;">N</span> is the number of
graph.</li>
  <li>Edit the <span style="font-family: monospace;">gnuplot.gp</span>
file</li>
  <li>Double-click on the name of the graph in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Graph</span> listbox in the main <span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis of Result</span> window of Lsd.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Here are the options available:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">set xlabel</span> :
determines the label for the X axis. The same command works for the <span style="font-family: monospace;">ylabel</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">zlabel</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">set dgrid3d 30,30,4</span>
: this command determines the definition of the graph. The first two
values (30,30 by default) indicate the number of segments used on the X
and Y axis. The higher this number the more precise is the graph (and
the heavier is the memory requirements). The third value (4 by default)
indicates the approximation for the Z values. The higher the closer.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">set pm3d</span> : draws a
surface connecting the points of the series. This is set by default.
Removing this line you generate a graph made only of lines or dots (as
indicated in the option <a href="#lines_points">Lines/Points</a> in
the main <span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis of Results</span>
window. For example, using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lines</span>
option you would obtain:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="ex3dsurface3.jpg" style="width: 606px; height: 432px;"><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">set palette gray</span>
or&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">set palette color</span>
: generate the surface in gray shades or colors (only if the option <span style="font-family: monospace;">set pm3d </span>is present). <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">set grid </span>:&nbsp;
uses a grid for the plane X-Y</li>
</ul>
After all the options have been given, there is the main command to
plot the series. The command indicates the file name from which to take
the data, the columns to use, and other options. For example, in order
to plot the two series in the example graphs the command is:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">splot 'data.gp' using 1:2:3 with
lines t "z1(1)", 'data.gp' using 1:2:4 with lines t "z2(1)"</span><br>
<br>
where: <br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">splot</span>: is the
command for a 3D graph</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">'data.gp'</span>: is the
data file</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">using 1:2:3</span> : is the
command sayng that the surface must use the data in columns 1 and 2 for
the independent variables, and 3 for the dependent variable.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">with lines</span> :
indicates to use lines to connect the points. Alternatievely, one can
be <span style="font-family: monospace;">points</span>, or <span style="font-family: monospace;">pm3d</span> for the surface only (but,
in the case, you need the option <span style="font-family: monospace;">set
pm3d</span>). <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">t "my tytle" </span>:
indicates the title for the series. To omit the title set <span style="font-family: monospace;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">t
""</span></span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
