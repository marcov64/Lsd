<br>
Lsd Models Manager (LMM) is an integrated environment used to generate,
modify and access one or more Lsd models. It consists of a normal text
editor (particularly suited for dealing with C++ source code), plus a
series
of commands to manage Lsd model programs. If LMM is loaded with a
model,
then its Lsd-related functionalities apply to that model. Otherwise,
with
no model loaded, LMM is just a simple editor.
<br>
Starting LMM you are shown a window with three options:
<br><br><br><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 160px;"><img style="width: 151px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="image385.JPG"></td><td><ul><li> <b>Browse existing Lsd modelsl</b>. Browse all the models
installed to select one to work on. This option allows also to create, move or delete models.</li><li> <b>Open a text file</b>. The system does not load any model,
but
offers
the possibility to use the LMM editor on an existing file.</li><li> <b>Create a new text file</b>. The system does not load any
model,
and
the editor contains an empty text file. It is possible to name the file
when saving.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<br>
&nbsp;Both LMM and Lsd are extensively documented by help pages in HTML
format.
<a href="#top">This
document</a> covers the use of LMM; it is roughly organized for menu
entries,
and each section is referred to in the buttons <b>Help</b> in any
interfaces.
For help on the use of a Lsd model refer to the <a href="TOC.html">Lsd
manual</a>, or look at the <a href="#hintro">Help on Help </a>section.

<hr width="100%">
<br>
<a name="install"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">LMM Installation</font></i></b>
<p>The code for the Lsd system is identical under any platform, since
it uses the same C++ compiler and libraries. Consequently, all the
distributions of Lsd can be used on any system.&nbsp;</p><p>The
installation consists unpacking the files and run LMM. Once this is
successfully done, LMM is used to generate run and generate Lsd models.</p><p>There
are three different packaging facilitating the installation procedures
on MS Windows, Linux and Mac systems. Details on the installation are
available in the README.txt file</p><p>&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>MS Windows Systems (from Win95 to Vista)</b>: Unpack the
zipped
file.
This will create a directory structure formed by one root directory,
called
LsdX.Y for Lsd version X.Y, and several subdirectories. Then run the
batch
program <big><tt>run.bat</tt> </big>in the Lsd root directory.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul>
  <li> <b>Unix Systems</b>: LMM and the Lsd programs require a GNU C++
compiler
(any version) and the Tcl/Tk libraries, the most recent version (8.5 at the last updating of this file). LMM is distributed
as
a standard tar-zipped file. To unpack the file move in the directory
were
the file is located and type:</li>
  <br>
  <font face="Courier New,Courier">&gt; tar xsf lsdXYunix.tgz</font> <br>
This creates a directory called Lsd and several subdirectories
descending
from the one in which you have copied your distribution file. Move in
the
newly created directory and compile LMM. <br>
  <font face="Courier New,Courier">&gt; cd LsdX.Y</font> <br>
  <font face="Courier New,Courier">&gt; make -f makefile.ln</font> <br>
On success run LMM with the command <br>
  <font face="Courier New,Courier">&gt; ./lmm</font>
</ul>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mac OS X 10.5</span>: There
are two options, using the X11 environment or generate a Mac native
code. In the former case, install the X11 system from the Mac
installation disks and follow the Unix instructions. Otherwise (and
recommended) you need to install the Developer Toolkit, from the
installation disks and the Tcl/Tk distribution from ActiveState site.
&nbsp;For older versions of Mac OS's see the instructions <a href="#mac">here</a>.&nbsp; </li></ul><p>
A distribution includes:

<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="editor"></a><b><i><font face="Arial">The LMM editor</font></i></b>
<br>
The LMM window is formed by a header bar and by a text editor. The
header bar contains the four menus (<a href="#file">File</a>, <a href="#edit">Edit</a>,
<a href="#model">Model</a>,
<a href="#help">Help</a>)
and indicates: the model selected, if any; the model's version number;
the file currently loaded in the editor, and the columns and line
position
of the cursor.
</p>
<p><img src="image1MQ.JPG" height="22" width="662"></p>
<p>The editor applies the usual rules for browsing text, selecting,
deleting
etc. Note that the most frequently used editing functions have also
key-based
shortcuts for faster access while typing, indicated along the items in
the menus. Moreover, a short popup menu is activated with the right
button
of the mouse.
</p>
<p>Although the editor deals with any kind of text file, when it loads
a file with extension cpp (or any extension related with C language)
are
applied different colors to facilitate the code reading. The C++
comments
(all the text included in between a /* and */ couple of characters, or
the line beginning with //) are highlighted in green. Moreover, strings
(all text included in between double quotes, excluding the \" cases)
are
written&nbsp; in blue.
<br>
Another binding useful for editing programming code is the automatic
tabbing. When a new line is inserted (pressing the key Return), the
editor
fills the beginning of the new line with as many spaces as in the
previous
line, facilitating the standard programming tab styles. See in <a href="#edit">Menu
Edit</a> a set of entries also useful for C++ coding.
</p>
<p><a name="file"></a><b><i><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Menu File</font></u></i></b>
<br>
This menu is pretty self-explanatory.
</p>
<p><a name="newfile"></a><b>New Text File </b>: create a new text
document,
initially labelled 'noname.txt'. When saving the document it is
possible
to change its name.
</p>
<p><a name="open"></a><b>Open </b>(shortcut Ctrl+o): open a new file
closing
the previous one (asking whether to save it, in case it is changed).
Note
that it is not necessary to open the files required by Lsd models since
these can be accessed directly using the menu items in <a href="#model">menu
Model</a>.
</p>
<p><a name="save"></a><b>Save </b>(shortcut Ctrl+s): save the current
file
with the same name used to open it. Check carefully whether you want to
overwrite existing files.
</p>
<p><a name="saveas"></a><b>Save as </b>(shortcut Ctrl+a): save the
current

</p>
<p><a name="quit"></a><b>Quit </b>(shortcut Ctrl+q): Quit LMM.
</p>
<p><a name="SystemOpt"></a><b>System Options</b>
<br>The user can specify the following options: consolle terminal; HTML
browser; font and exact name of the wish,. The terminal is the command
to be used when launching the GDB debugger. The browser is used to show
the helpl pages. The font is the name of the fonts to be used in LMM as
text. Wish is used to run interpreted scripts in Tcl/Tk languages,
mainly used by TkDiff (see <a href="#tkdiff">TkDiff</a> and <a href="#compmod">Compare Models</a>
in menu Edit). If these functionalities do not work then open a
terminal in your system and find out how wish is called (e.g. wish8.4).
Clicking on the default button provides the most common options for the
operative system used.
</p>

<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="edit"></a><b><i><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Menu Edit</font></u></i></b>
<br>
This menu deals with the editing of the file shown in the LMM editor.
Besides the usual copy/paste operation, it offers several facilities
targeted
to operate on C++ source code, and Lsd equations in particular:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#goto">Goto line</a>; <a href="#search">Find</a>; <a href="#again">Find
again</a>; <a href="#repl">Replace</a></li>
  <li> <a href="#match">Match { }</a>; <a href="#matchp">Match ( )</a>;</li>

  <li> <a href="#tkdiff">TkDiff</a></li>
</ul>
<p><br>
Note that most of the commands can be activated using intuitive
shortcuts of the type Control+X to speed up their use.
</p>
<p><a name="goto"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a><b> Goto Line </b>(shortcut:
Ctrl+l):
<br>
Go to the chosen line number in the shown text. The corresponding line
is moved at the center of the window and highlighted. This function is
very useful to find error messages in compilation, since they are
referred
to by the line number.
</p>
<p><a name="search"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Find Text </b>(shortcut:
Ctrl+f):
<br>
Find a text in the document shown. The search start from the current
position of the cursor downwards or upwards, depending as specified,
and
is interrupted at the first instance found. It is possible to make
either
a case sensitive or insensitive search. If the searched characters are
found, they are brought in the center of the text window and
highlighted.
Otherwise, the small entry window to insert the text remains visible
and
its content is selected for an easy replacement. The small entry window
accepts, besides the buttons Ok and Esc commands, also the equivalent
keys
Return and Escape.
</p>
<p><a name="again"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Find Again</b>
(shortcut: F3):
<br>
Find again the same text as specified in the previous Find Text (and
applies the same settings). Provide a quick way to find one specific
instance
of a frequently repeated pattern.
</p>
<p><a name="repl"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Replace (</b>shortcut:
Ctrl+r<b>):</b>
<br>
Search for a text pattern and replace the text, if found. Three buttons
are available in the Replace window:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search: searches for the text;</li>
  <li>Replace: replace the selected text after a search and immediately
repeat
the searche for a new occurrence;</li>
  <li>Replace all: replace the currently selected text and continue
searching
and replacing until the end of the text.</li>
</ul>
The Replace window accepts as keys the button Return for Search and Esc
as Close.
<p><a name="match"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Match { } </b>(shortcut:
Ctrl+m):
<br>
Find the graph bracket matching the one close to the current insertion
cursor. It is very useful when working with C++. In fact, in complex
C++
programs the blocks of lines (for example, in the <font face="Courier New,Courier">if-then-else</font>
statements, the <font face="Courier New,Courier">for</font> and while
cycles,
etc.) are defined by { and } graph brackets. It is very easy to get
lost
in the sequences of open and close brackets, and errors due to the
absence
or redundancy of a bracket are very difficult to identify.
</p>
<p>The function is very simple to use. If the character on the right of
the insertion cursor is a {, then the function scans downward the text
stopping at the } character matching the initial {, that is, skipping
the
couples {} found during the research. In case the character on the
right
of the insertion point is a }, then the scan is made backwards.
</p>
<p>When the matching bracket is found, both the initial and the found
one
are highlighted, while the text shows the part of the code containing
the
found one. If the two brackets are pretty far apart in the text, the
user
may want either to focus on the initial bracket or on the just found
one.
Users have are alternatives after a successful search: using the arrow
keys, the window immediately return showing the initial bracket.
Otherwise,
clicking with the mouse over the shown area, that becomes the active
one
and can be treated normally.
</p>
<p>In case the search fails, meaning that the end of the text were
reached
before finding the matching bracket, an error sound is emitted. In case
the character on the right of the insertion point is neither a } or a
{,
then the function does nothing.
</p>
<p><a name="matchp"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Match ( ) </b>(shortcut:
Ctrl+p):
<br>
Same as for <a href="#match">Match { }</a> but applies to the
parenthesis.
</p>
<p><a name="insertopengr"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Insert
{ </b>(shortcut: Ctrl+'(' ):
<br>
In some systems endowed with international settings (non USA keyboards)
it is difficult to insert the badly needed graph brackets. This items,
and specially its shortcuts, saves a lot of laborious work.
</p>
<p><a name="insertclosegr"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Insert

<br>
In some systems endowed with international settings (non USA keyboards)
it is difficult to insert the badly needed graph brackets. This items,
and specially its shortcuts, saves from a lot of laborious work.
</p>
<p><a name="LsdScript"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Insert
Lsd
Script (Shortcur: Ctrl+i)</b>:
<br>
Insert in the insertion cursor point a frequently used Lsd script (the
equation style between C++ or Lsd macros depends on the <a href="#select_macro">option</a>
chosen). This function is merely implemented to allow modellers to
quickly
include frequently used code, minimizing the number of typing mistakes.
It is possible, of course, to edit the text inserted with this
function,
as any text typed manually.
<br>
The item activates a window listing the scripts currently available
for automatic insertion (see the help page on <a href="lsdfuncMacro.html">Lsd
functions</a> for the complete set of Lsd functions available). When a
choice is made, an interface requesting the values necessary for the
script
appears. The interfaces contain already a default value for each item
to
insert, and modellers can move from one item to the next just pressing
<b>Return</b>
(the usual key <b>Escape</b> aborts the process at any moment).
</p>
<p>Pay attention to the highlighted letters in the list of available
functions.
They are also used as short-cuts pressing Control and one of the upper
case letters. For example, pressing Control and 'V' the interface to
insert
a V(...) function is activated.
</p>

<hr width="100%"><br>
<a name="wrap"></a><a href="#edit">(menu Edit)</a> <b>Wrap Text/No
Wrap </b>(shortcut Ctrl+'w'):
<br>
The text window can be set either to wrap the text so to not spill
over the right side. At the start, the default is no wrapping, so that
the end part of long lines can be read only scrolling the text on the
right.
Choosing this item the setting alternate between wrapping and not
wrapping
the text. The wrapping does not affect the saved file, but only the
appearence.

Coding Style</b>
<br>
Allows to choose between the traditional C++ form for expressing the
code in the Lsd equations, or to use the simpler <a href="#lsd_macro">macro
language</a>. Depending on which coding style is used, LMM will provide
the corresponding <a href="#LsdScript">Lsd script</a> to be inserted
in
the equations, and will mutate the <a href="#helpeq">Help page on the
equation</a>
coding.
<br>
Note that users can blend the two languages in the same models,
expressing
some part of the code in C++ and others in the Lsd macro.
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="select_macro"></a><a href="#model">(menu Model)</a> <b>Equation
Codying Style</b>
<br>
Tell LMM to use pure C++ codying style or the simpler Lsd macro codying
style.
<br>
Lsd models implement the Variables' equations in C++, which are stored
as blocks of code in the model equations file. Besides writing the
equations
in C++, users can also use a macro language, which uses shorter
keywords
for the most common operations. It is also possible to mix in the same
model standard C++ and the macro language, although generally this may
be confusing.
<br>
Depending on this option, LMM will insert the <a href="#LsdScript">Lsd
scripts</a> in the chosen style. Also the <a href="#helpeq">Lsd
equation
help</a> menu item will be selected according to this option.
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="select"></a><a href="#model">(menu Model)</a> <b>Browse
Models</b>
<br>
This functionality allows to manage the models available on your Lsd
installation. The models are organized each in one directory, and these
directories are organized in "groups" containing related models.
<br>
Users willing to experiment with one of the existing model need only
to browse the models available and choose one to work with. The system
will automatically refer to the files concerning the chosen model.
<br>
Modellers developing new model programs can use the other
functionalities
to organize properly the set of models in suitable groups (e.g. move a
finished model from the "Work" group to the "PaperXXX" group).
</p>
<p>Using the "Lsd Models" browser windows it is possible to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>select one of the existing models;</li>
  <li>create new groups, meant to store sets of related models;</li>
  <li>create new empty models, to be used as basic structure to fill
out a
new
model;</li>
  <li>"copy" a model from one group and "paste" it in another group;</li>
  <li>delete existing models. Note that the directories containing the
models
are not actually deleted, but are moved under the directory "Trashbin",
for possible re-use. To re-install the "deleted" models it is necessary
to find the directory of interest in the trashbin and move it manually
in one of the groups.</li>
  <li>edit labels and descriptions of models and groups.</li>
</ul>
When necessary, the above functions will request the relevant
information
in self-explaining forms. In all cases pressing Escape will abort the
current
operation.
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<p><a name="run"></a><a href="#model">(menu Model)</a> <b>Run Lsd Model</b>
<br>
Compile, if necessary, and run the Lsd model program.
<br>
The system checks that all the files necessary for the Lsd model
program
have been compiled, and then run the resulting Lsd model program (see <a href="TOC.html">here
the manual </a>for the Lsd model program interfaces).
<br>
Three possible outputs are possible from this command:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Lsd model program (successful compilation);</li>
  <li>an error message appears (failed compilation);</li>
  <li>a warning message (possibly failed compilation)</li>
</ul>
Both in case of error or warning a new window gives the details of the
messages from the compilation process. The warning message is issued
when
the compilation did issue messages, but a copy of the Lsd model program
exists. This may happen in radically different cases:
<br>
1) the compilation problems did not prevent a successful creation of
the Lsd model program, which is therefore updated with the latest
equations'
code;
<br>
2) the compilation failed, but an old copy of the Lsd model program
(with old equations) exists. In this case, the copy does not contain
the
latest (faulty) equations' code. This happens when a previous version
of
the Lsd model program had been successfully compiled (and is still
present
on the disk).
<p>The compilation messages indicate which of the two cases you are in.
Compilation messages indicating only warnings are innocuous. Instead,
terms
like errors, failure, stop etc. indicate that the compilation failed.
See
in the following for information on the most frequent errors.
</p>
<p><b>Frequent Compilation Errors</b>
<br>
In case of compilation errors, the system issues a warning and presents
the compiler's error messages (the window containing the errors can be
close and re-opened with the command <b>Show Compilation Results</b>
in
menu <b>Run</b>). There are two possible sources of errors:
programming
bugs and LMM configuration errors.
</p>
<p>Programming errors are caused by violations of the C++ grammar in
the
equation files (of course, a C++ legal equation code is not necessarily
doing what it is expected to do, but this can be seen only at run
time).
Programming errors are signalled with lines like:
</p>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">XXX.cpp:301 ...</font></b>
</p>
<p>meaning that in the file XXX.cpp (typically the equation file of the
model) at line 301 an error has been found (note the command <b>Goto
Line</b>
in menu <b>Edit</b>).
<br>
The possibilities of the compiler to indicate exactly where the error
is located are limited. For example, a missing semi-colon (possibly the
most frequent error) is indicated in the message as an error in the
following
line.
<br>
The compilation of the source files is sequential, so that frequently
one error on one line causes a number of (apparent) other errors in the
following lines. Fix the errors indicated in the earliest positions
(top
messages) and try to recompile without searching for the mass of
following
errors.
<br>
The nastiest errors are caused by the wrong number of open- and
close-brackets:
{ and }. The compiler fails to individuate the location of the missing
(or redundant) bracket, although it totally misread all the code,
therefore
issuing a lot of fake messages. If everything seems correct at the
lines
indicated in the error messages, test the brackets of the equation file
(starting with the very first one) using the command <b>Match </b>{}
in
menu <b>Edit </b>(see <a href="#match">here</a> for help on this):
each
open bracket must match with a closing one. If no matching bracket is
found,
then there is the problem.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to write code without writing bugs, so that it is
important
to learn to discover them quickly. However, this is possible only if
one
has a reasonable idea where to start the research, and therefore it is
highly recommended to write few lines and then compile. Even if the
written
code does not mean anything yet, at least one can clean-up the typing
mistakes.
</p>
<p>Configuration errors occur when the system does not find required
libraries
where expected, or they are mispelled. These errors cause messages
like:
</p>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">No rule to make target `XXX.cpp'</font></b>
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p><b><tt><font size="+1">cannot open -ltcl8.0: No such file or
directory</font></tt></b>
</p>
<p>and, in general, messages not related to the content of the equation
file. In this case the error signals that either the whole package is
not
configured properly, or that the model does not contain some crucial
information.
These errors generally occur once during the very first time the system
is used, and then they never appear again. Use the commands for the <b>System
Compilation Options </b>and <b>Model Compilation Options</b> in menu <b>Model</b>
to fix the errors (see <a href="#compilation_options">here</a> for
help
on this topic).
</p>
<p>The system allows to run many copies of the same Lsd model program.
However they must all share the same equation file. This is because it
is not possible to replace the files of programs currently running.
Therefore,
if you are using a Lsd model program for a simulation run, and then try
to recompile it with a modified equation file, the system may give a
message
like this:
</p>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">ld: cannot open output file
lsd_gnu.exe:
Permission denied</font></b>
</p>
<p>In this case, either close the running Lsd model program, or re-compile.

<p><a name="debug"></a><a href="#model">(menu Model)</a> <b>Debug</b>
<br>
Use the <i>gdb</i> debugger to follow the simulation
instruction-by-instruction.
A debugger is a program that allows other programs to run in a
controlled
environment. When a program is run in a debugger, it is possible to
observe
in detail what it does, for example interrupting its calculations and
checking
the values of its internal variables. The debugger works as if the
single
lines of code fire their commands only when explicitly directed.
</p>
<p>Note that the <i>gdb</i> is a C++ debugger, which, therefore, knows
nothing of Lsd equations, Objects etc., but their technical
representation.
<i>gdb</i>
permits, for example, to investigate line by line the execution of an
equation.
However, this means that one has also to follow line-by-line a lot of
non-interesting
technical code. Lsd programmers may find much more useful the Lsd
Debugger:
it permits to follow a simulation by individual equations. When one
Variable,
marked to be debugged, is computed, the Lsd debugger interrupts the
simulation,
shows the value produced in the equation, the values of v[n] temporary
values, the whole models' values, etc., permitting to understand, most
of times, the cause of an error. See the <a href="debug.html">Lsd
Debugger
help page</a>. However, the <i>gdb</i> debugger is still useful in
case
of very hard problems.
</p>
<p>The Lsd model program in the debugger runs as usual (slightly
slower,
if anything) but the user can interrupt the program at any point, check
the value of any variable, make the program proceed by single steps,
and
a whole series of other functionality meant to help finding out
misbehaviours
or errors in the program.
</p>
<p>In case of a Lsd model program, it is usually useful to focus on one
equation and see the behaviour of the program while executing that
code.
In the following, few gdb commands are reported. They all take the form
of commands to be typed at the line prompt of the gdb shell. More
information
can be found in the gdb manual, available on the net, or simply typing
help in the gdb shell, possibly followed by a precise command.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>break fun_XXX.cpp:132</b>: places a breakpoint at line 132
of
the file
fun_XXX.cpp. When the execution of the program reaches that line, gdb
interrupts
the program and offers the users with the gdb prompt.</li>
  <li> <b>break 232</b>: places a break in the currently considered
source
file
at line 232;</li>
  <li> <b>break myfu</b>n: places a breakpoint at the first line of
the
function
myfun;</li>
  <li> <b>break variable::fun</b> places a breakpoint at the first
line of
the
method fun of the object variable.</li>
  <li> <b>run</b>: causes the program to run. The execution will be
interrupted
at one of the following events: the normal end of the program is
reached;
the flow of the program finds a breakpoint; the program crashes.</li>
  <li> <b>print X</b>: shows the content of the variable X</li>
  <li> <b>display X</b>: shows the content of the variable X, which
remains visible
through other commands (e.g. next, step etc.) until undisplay is called.</li>
  <li> <b>step</b>: makes just one step in the execution of the program</li>
  <li> <b>next</b>: like step, but, if a subfunction is found, next
"step
over"
it without entering within the code of the function</li>
  <li> <b>continue</b>: resort the program continuing after an
interruption;</li>
  <li> <b>delete [n]</b>: remove the breakpoints. If no number is
specified all
the breakpoints are removed. Otherwise, only the one marked with the
specified
number is eliminated.</li>
  <li> <b>list</b>: shows the source code lines above and after the
one
that is
going to be executed.</li>
  <li> <b>list -10 [10]</b>: shows 10 previous [subsequent] lines in
respect of
the one shown before.</li>
  <li> <b>cond 2 v[0] == 3</b>: assigns a condition to a breakpoint,
so
that the
execution is interrupted only if the condition is true. In the example,
the second breakpoint specified is active only if the value of v[0] is
identical to 3, otherwise the execution will not be interrupted.</li>
  <li> <b>bt (backtrace)</b>: shows the stack of the program. It is
the
list of
functions that are called at the moment in the execution of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
For more information on this and other commands, use the help in
gdb (just type help and the name of the command). Moreover, in gdb
works
the command completion, so that typing, for example, "disp" and then
pressing
the tab key, the command display is automatically completed. In case of
possible ambiguity (e.g. typing only "dis" and tab) the prompt shows
the
list of alternative among which to choose (this is also a weird, but
rather
useful, way to discover new functionalities).

Equation</b>
</p>
<p>The entry <b>Show Equation</b> opens in the LMM editor the file
containing
the equations for the selected model. The equation file is a normal C++
source file, that LMM uses to create a Lsd model program. The modeller
writes in this file the code for the equations in separated blocks,
whose
order is of no importance for the actual order the Variables are
updated.
<br>
There are two possibilities to express the code for an equation: the
standard C++ expressions (see <a href="lsdfunc.html">here</a> the
manual)
or a <a href="#lsd_macro">macro language</a>, much simpler especially
for
novel modellers.
<br>
The equation file shown in LMM should be used only for editing a model
and should not be used just for studying a model, since it is not easy
to reconstruct the functioning of a model looking at the code of the
equations
only. In fact, there is no relation between the order of the variables
blocks and their actual order of execution during a simulation run. To
browse a model's code Lsd model programs offers to far better
alternatives.
Lsd model programs contains several facilities to browse the model
structure
(i.e. Object, Variables and Parameters) and equations (see, for
example,
the
<a href="Browser.html#variables">equations windows</a>). Moreover,
the Lsd models produce HTML documents ( <a href="menufile.html#report">Model
Report</a>), accessible directly from the Help menu of the Lsd model
programs,
that list all the elements of the model including the equations' code.

The first is peculiar to one model, while the others are common to all

</b>and<b>
Model Compilation Options</b>
<br>
Set the compilation options for the whole system and for the model
respectively. That is, these options are used to create the makefiles
used
to compile and link the models according to the local settings and
user's
preferences.
<br>
Creating a Lsd model program requires, besides the code, the exact
name and location of several system files. This information is not
perfectly
standard, particularly comparing Windows and Unix environment. These
two
commands permit to fix problems due to non-standars systems, or to
easily
compile a model developed under a different operative system.
Generally,
the default values proposed should suit most cases, and are applied by
the buttons for the Windows and Linux OS's . However, in the following
I list the details of how Lsd model programs are created (non-expert
users
can ignore this).
</p>
<p>Lsd is compiled with a standard C++ GNU compiler. It is assumed that
most Unix system have already installed this. The Windows version comes
with an extract of the CYGWIN package, a port of the GNU project under
Win32 by Cygnus (released under the GNU GPL). The Windows installation
stores in the directory LsdXXX/src all the necessary stuff. In this
way,
identical code is compiled seamlessly under different OS's, e.g., both
under Linux and Windows 2000.
</p>
<p>The makefile's for the models are created by three different parts:
<br>
- Model specific settings, valid for a single model (stored in the
model_options.txt in each model directory)
<br>
- System-wide settings, valid for all the models (stored in the file
system_options.txt in the Lsd root directory)
<br>
- The body of a makefile used by all models (stored in the file
makefile_base.txt
in the Lsd root directory)
</p>
<p>When a makefile must be created (e.g creating a new model or
changing
the compilation options), the system merge the three parts above. Using
the system and model compilation option commands users can modify the
first
and second part indicated above, since the body of the makefile does
not
neet any customization. The required settings are indicated in the
following
tables, along with the default values.

NO WINDOW makefile</span><br>
This option generates a packaged version of the LSD model, including
the LSD source code and the model, to be compiled without using the
graphical interfaces. This version of LSD requires only a GCC compiler
to run a simulation, so that it can be run on systems not endowed with
TCL/TK.<br>
Since there are no interfaces, the NO WINDOW version needs a
configuration file (.lsd) already prepared. The simulation results will
be automatically stored in files, to be loaded in a normal version of
LSD for analysis and/or conversion in different formats.<br>
<br>
To use the non graphical version of the system you need the following
files, taken from the model directory:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Equation file, normally called <big style="font-family: monospace;">fun_mymodel.cpp</big></li>
  <li>One or more configuration files, extension <big style="font-family: monospace;">.lsd</big></li>
  <li>the makefile called "<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">makefileNW</span></big>"</li>
  <li>the whole directory "<big><span style="font-family: monospace;">src</span></big>"
contained within the model directory.</li>
</ol>
To compile and use the non graphical version of LSD, follow these steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Move the model directory on the system you want to use. You
actually need only the files indicated above. The "<big style="font-family: monospace;">src</big>" directory must be contained
within the model directory.</li>
  <li>compile the lsd model program with the command: <big style="font-family: monospace;">make -f makefileNW</big>. You may need
to adjust the variables in the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">makefileNW </span></big>depending on
your system. The <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">makefileNW
    </span></big>includes the options used on the original system, but
they are mostly not used, since, for example, the non-graphical version
does not link to the TclTk libraries. <br>
  </li>
  <li>the resulting exectuable file requires a Lsd configuration file
describing the model and its initializations and options. Run a
simulation with the command: <big style="font-family: monospace;">lsd_gnu
-f sim1.lsd</big>, where the name of the executable can change
depending on your <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">makefileNW
    </span></big>( variable TARGET) and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">sim1.lsd </span></big>must be
replaced with your configuration file.</li>
  <li>After each simulation run the system automatically generates a
LSD result file (extension <big style="font-family: monospace;">.res</big>)
containing the data for the variables indicated with the option Saved.</li>
  <li>Open the result files with any graphical version of LSD to
analyse the results and/or export the data in other formats.<br>
  </li>

<br>
The <a href="#help">menu Help</a> in LMM, as well as the <a href="menuhelp.html">menu
Help
</a>in the Lsd model programs, provides access to an extensive set
of help pages, covering every aspect of model writing and using. The
help
pages are necessary to fully exploit this language, and therefore users
are strongly invited to make use of the manual pages. Generally
speaking,
help pages are structured as a hypertextual document where each window
or function related to Lsd is devoted a section, so to answer the
questions
"What does this mean?" or "How do I use this?". Of course, each section
is filled with links to sections for related issues.
<br>
There are three levels of documentation:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="LMM_help.html#top">Help on LMM</a>. How to start the
system, run
an existing model program, or create a new one.</li>
  <li> <a href="TOC.html">Help on Lsd interfaces</a>. How to exploit
an
existing

etc.</li>
  <li>Model specific documentation (model report). This document is
accessible
from the menu Help of each Lsd model program and indicates what a given
Object, Variable or Parameter represents, in which part of the model is
used, what are the initial values, the equations' code. This document
is
partially created automatically fetching the necessary information from
the structure of the model, and then allowing modellers to add free
comments
for any element of the model.</li>
</ul>
users are expected to test every aspect of the software, and to see in
the manual the related page for instruction on its use (or explanation
on "what does this mean?").
<p>The manual is written as HTML pages (like web documents) that users
are supposed to keep open in a Netscape (or any web browser like
Internet
Explorer) while working with Lsd. The manual pages are endowed with
links
that permit to "jump" to related topics. Usually, using the "back"
command
of Netscape permits to find any help required. If users get lost in a
pattern
of subsequent "jumps", the best way is to re-start from the first
manual
page used.
</p>
<p>The manual contains at least one page for each operation. For LMM
and
Lsd the help pages are organized according to the menus where the
commands
are placed. Each help page begins with the picture of the interface,
and
the list of the commands available (see, for example, the <a href="menudata.html">help

listed in the LMM help menu. For a manual page on a Lsd interface, the
usual starting page for using Lsd is the <a href="TOC.html">Table of
Contents</a>,
offering links to the main Lsd windows and other useful topics. A short
list of help on frequently used operations is contained in the <a href="QuickHelp.html">Quick
Help </a>page.

<h3><a name="mac"></a>Using Lsd on Mac OS X &lt; 10.4</h3>
Matthieu Farcot managed to install Lsd on a Mac OS X and kindly offers
these guidelines.
<p>As LSD was designed to work on UNIX, why couldn&#8217;t we use it under
MAC
OSX? This little help file is here to do just what it should: show you
how to install LSD on OSX. Now one would ask: if this application is
written
to run on a UNIX system, why can&#8217;t I run it on MAC OSX? Well&#352; Part of
an
answer lies here:
<br>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/architecture">http://developer.apple.com/macosx/architecture</a>
<br>
As you see or might know, the roots of Mac OS X lie on Darwin. And
on the other end, we have that nice Aqua interface. The problem is that
LSD can run on Darwin, but not using Aqua. So what we need to do is
install
first another window management "system", one that would be compatible
with both Aqua and LSD. And of course, we need to implement a few
libraries
that are not installed as standard on Mac OSX. And of course, all
software
that we will use will be open-source.
</p>
<p>1  Let&#8217;s begin
<br>
Make sure that you have admin and/or root access on the Macintosh you
want to work on:
<br>
To enable the root user, open netInfo Manager, and select menu
domain/security/autentification.
You will be prompted for an admin right login window.
<br>
Once that is filled, if you go again in the domain/security menu,
you&#8217;ll
see a new option: "enable root user".&nbsp; Select it. You then will be
prompted for a root
<br>
password.
<br>
One word about that password: never, EVER forget it. Trust me. And
don&#8217;t use the root account for everyday&#8217;s use.
</p>
<p>1.1  System requirements:
<br>
- A computer (Macintosh, preferably) - MAC OS X (min 10.1.x) with an
administrative privileged account - The latest MAC OS X Developer Tools
(free
<br>
download at http://connect.apple.com ) - Some basic knowledge of the
terminal - A good Internet connection - A good amount of free disk
space
</p>
<p>1.2 - LSD 5 download
<br>
Start by downloading the LSD 5.0 Unix Zip archive (3.2 MB) from
http://www.business.auc.dk/lsd
Stuffit Expander should UnZip automatically a LSD
<br>
folder on your Desktop. Check the ReadMe.txt in the folder for any
new updates.
<br>
If you like working in the OSX&#8217;s GUI, first be sure to install
TinkerTool,
from http://www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool2.html and to check in this
System
<br>
Preference module the "show hidden files and system files" box under
the Finder tab. Very useful to see the hidden directories we will work
with.
</p>
<p>1.3  GCC download
<br>
We will need the GNU Compiler Collection to use LSD. Some part of what
is need has been installed by the developer tools installation, but we
need a bit
<br>
more.
<br>
So connect to: http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0 And download the binaries
from the mirror server the closer to your place.
<br>
UPDATE: GCC 3 is now part of the latest deveoper tools. How-to is to
be modified.
</p>
<p>1.4  GDB download
<br>
To get the GNU Project Debugger, connect to this site:
http://sources.redhat.com/gdb
And again, select the archive the closer to you.
</p>
<p>The choice is now yours. In part 2, we suppose you have a fast
Internet
access on your computer. We will use Fink, an excellent package
management
tool
<br>
greatly inspired by DEBIAN to easily install Xfree86 (an X Window
server)
and the TCL/TK libs.
<br>
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.1  Fink install
<br>
What is Fink? As stated on their website (<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">http://fink.sourceforge.net</a>),
the Fink project is a modification of UNIX software so that they can
compile
and run
<br>
on Darwin. This is the tool we&#8217;ll use to install the different
libraries
needed to run LSD.
<br>
So. Start by downloading the fink install image here: <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.4.0-installer.dmg">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.4.0-installer.dmg</a>
<br>
Run the installation package that is on the newly mounted image.
<br>
Open a new Terminal window, and type:
<br>
pico .cshrc
<br>
source /sw/bin.csh (press enter here)
<br>
Press control-o, enter and control-x.
<br>
Close the terminal window. Re-launch one. Fink should be set up and
working. To test it, type sudo apt-get update in your terminal. Then,
type
sudo fink
<br>
list and after a while, fink should show you a list of packages to
install.
</p>
<p>2.2 - Xfree86 installation
<br>
To install Xfree, a X Window integration in Mac OSX, we will use the
newly installed app. In your terminal type :
<br>
sudo apt-get install xfree86-base
<br>
The downloaded file will automatically compile and install itslef.
Once that process is over, type in your terminal window:
<br>
sudo apt-get install xfree86-rootless
<br>
Done now for X Windows! Check in your application folder: there should
be a new app, Xdarwin. Open it, select the rootless mode, and after a
few
<br>
minutes, a few apps should load in the new X Window System we installed
 Note: it can take some time to load at first  Beware, as the
keyboard layout
<br>
is in the QWERTY format on the X Terminal. To change that format, in
Xdarwin, go to the preferences pane, in start up, select another
keyboard
file in the
<br>
list.
</p>
<p>2.3  Tcl/TK installation
<br>
Again in your terminal, type :
<br>
sudo fink install tcltk
<br>
That&#8217;s it !
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
</p>
<p>3.1 - Xfree Installation
<br>
The version of the X Windows system will be Xfree86 4.1 You can grab
the binaries here:
<br>
ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/Xfree86/4.2.0/binaries/Darwin-ppc-5.x/ (be
sure to check their README file). Download all the files in here, and
simply
put them
<br>
all in a folder on your desktop (here called xfree for the example).
<br>
After, use the terminal application to install it by typing:
<br>
cd ~/Desktop/xfree sudo sh Xinstall.sh
</p>
<p>The first command indicates that you want to go to the xfree folder
on your desktop, whereas the second one will prompt you for your root
password
<br>
(check the first part for help about that) and start the installation.
</p>
<p>Install all of the modules by answering "yes" to the different
questions
that you will be asked, apart from the last one, about creating a link
to the restart
<br>
utility, that should be answered "no".
<br>
Xfree86 is now installed. But one more thing remains to be settled
about it: make the X Window run "rootless", or otherwise, it would run
full screen.
<br>
To make it run rootless, download this patch:
<br>
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xonx/Xdarwin1.0.6.1.tgz
</p>
<p>and then use your terminal to type:
<br>
cd / sudo tar zxvf ~/Desktop/Xdarwin1.0.0.6.1.tgz cd ~/Library mkdir
init cd init mkdir tcsh cd tcsh pico path
<br>
(in pico, then type:)
<br>
set path =($path /usr/X11R6/bin)
<br>
(save by typing control-o then enter, and quit using the control-x
and enter commands, then type:)
<br>
cp /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc
<br>
Done now for X Windows! Check in your application folder: there should
be a new app, Xdarwin. Open it, select the rootless mode, and after a
few
<br>
minutes, a few apps should load in the new X Window System we installed
 Note: it can take some time to load at first  Beware, as the
keyboard layout
<br>
is in the QWERTY format on the X Terminal. To change that format, in
Xdarwin, go to the preferences pane, in start up, select another
keyboard
file in the
<br>
list.
</p>
<p>3.2: TCL/TK installation
<br>
Start by grabbing those two tar.gz files:
<br>
http://dev.scriptics.com/download/tcl/tcl8_3/tk8.3.3.tar.gz
<br>
and
<br>
http://dev.scriptics.com/download/tcl/tcl8_3/tcl8.3.3.tar.gz
</p>
<p>unpack the Tcl files with the command:
</p>
<p># tar xzf tcl8.3.3.tar.gz
</p>
<p>cd to the directory tcl8.3.3/unix and type the three commands:
</p>
<p># ./configure
<br>
# ./make
<br>
# ./make install
</p>
<p>repeat the same for the Tk files
