To create Windows self-extracting package

1. Get 7-Zip LZMA SDK at https://www.7-zip.org (ex. lzma1900.7z)
2. Copy 7zr.exe and 7zSD.sfx to gnu\installer folder in LSD installation
3. Open 7zSD.sfx in an hex editor (like HxD), find the value at 0x3C (pointer to header), add 0x40 to that value (static offset of Major OS Version within PE header), and get the offset to the Major OS Version, changed to 0x07 for windows 7+
4. Modify config-installer-windows.txt extraction configuration if needed
5. Add files/patterns to exclude to exclude-installer-windows.txt
6. Run create-installer-windows.bat to create installer
